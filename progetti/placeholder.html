<hr />
<p>My August has been spent relaxing and staying away from work and from
computers as much as possible. As I am gearing up to come back to the
grind, I have decided to ramp things up gradually. So I found myself
rewriting my website from scratch, and here is the logbook.</p>
<h3 id="the-problem">The problem</h3>
<p>Up until now, I have been using the <em>very nice</em> <a
href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a> Jekyll
template. It is as fully-fledged as one may want. In my case, however,
it is a bit <em>too</em> complex. I really only need a landing page with
contacts, a list of papers I have worked on, and some super basic blog
thing that supports maths typesetting, images and codeblocks.
Furthermore, in exchange for this plethora of possibilities, I had to
keep a Jekyll toolchain around, as well as a Ruby installation.</p>
<p>I update this website way too infrequently to justify all of this
toolchain-friction. So I was looking for something a bit simpler.</p>
<h3 id="the-requirements">The requirements</h3>
<p>Basically, I want to have a set of markdown files where I write down
stuff and a very simple command that turns everything into a bundle of
HTML files that are reasonably interlinked. A lightweight system allows
for quicker write-deploy cycles, so if rubbish appears in the deployed
site I can fix it quickly.</p>
<h3 id="the-tools">The tools</h3>
<p>All of this has a solution: <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>
with some CSS template. It plays nicely with <a
href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> for maths typesetting, and
it is a tool I have used a lot in the past. The secret sauce, then, is
to ask Claude Sonnet 4 to come up with the skeleton.</p>
<h3 id="the-result">The result</h3>
<p>Well, you are looking at the result right now. The structure of the
directory is the following:</p>
<pre><code>website
├── Makefile
├── src/
│   ├── index.md
│   ├── template.html
│   ├── style.css
│   ├── blog.md
│   ├── papers.md
│   ├── blog/
│   │   ├── post1.md
│   │   └── post2.md
│   └── imgs/
│       ├── avatar.jpg
│       └── post1/
│           ├── img1.png
│           └── img2.png
└── build/
    ├── index.html
    ├── blog.html
    ├── papers.html
    ├── blog/
    │   ├── post1.html
    │   └── post2.html
    └── imgs/
        ├── avatar.jpg
        └── post1/
            ├── img1.png
            └── img2.png</code></pre>
<p>Basically, <code>build</code> contains the HTML versions of the
markdown files in <code>src</code>, as specified by
<code>template.html</code> and <code>style.css</code>.</p>
<p>The secret sauce is then the <code>Makefile</code>. It basically
calls <code>pandoc</code> with all the appropriate flags, copies files,
and all that jazz. It also deals with the maths typesetting. Really
sweet.</p>
<h3 id="version-control-and-deployment">Version control and
deployment</h3>
<p>The only <code>git</code>-controlled folder is <code>build</code>,
which only contains HTML files. Deployment happens by calling
<code>make deploy</code>, which adds-commits-pushes the changes in
<code>build</code> to the Github pages repo. The actual deployment is
super quick, as all the HTML is ready to be displayed.</p>
<p>Let’s see how long it takes for me to become unhappy at this system.
I am rather optimistic for now however.</p></main>
